## Heading ##
  > Goolp - aggregate restaurant reviews from Google && Yelp

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This is a great tool for anyone that is hungry and is looking for the best place to eat.

## Summary ##
  > Online restaurant reviews tend to vary across different websites. Imagine this: you look up a specific restaurant on Yelp and see that it has 3 stars overall. Then you look up the same restaurant on Google Maps. It has 4.3 stars overall. Confusion takes over and you don't know which website to trust. Goolp solves this issue by returning an aggregate restaurant review overall count (Yelp + Google) in order to help you make an informed food-cision.

## Problem ##
  > Solves the problem of different websites showing different reviews for the same place. (Ex. Restaurants). Goolp gets the reviews from the different websites and shows you a combines review count.

## Solution ##
  > Get the aggregate review count in one place! Just enter your location, restaurant name/cuisine and see the results right away!
